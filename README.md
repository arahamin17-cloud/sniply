# sniply

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [v0](https://v0.app).

## Built with v0

This repository is linked to a [v0](https://v0.app) project. You can continue developing by visiting the link below -- start new chats to make changes, and v0 will push commits directly to this repo. Every merge to `main` will automatically deploy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Authentication configuration

Authentication uses Better Auth with Drizzle and Neon Postgres (email + password with email verification, and Google). Sign-in, sign-up, the account page (`/account`), password reset and the link-analytics API all use this one system. Configure these environment variables in Vercel (Production scope) and locally, then **redeploy** - Vercel only applies env changes to new deployments:

```bash
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://eslotmain.xyz
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
RESEND_API_KEY=...
RESEND_EMAIL_DOMAIN=eslotmain.xyz
```

- **Google:** in Google Cloud Console add `https://eslotmain.xyz/api/auth/callback/google` as an authorized redirect URI (and `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` for local testing). If the OAuth consent screen is in "Testing" mode, only listed test users can sign in - publish it for everyone.
- **Email:** `RESEND_EMAIL_DOMAIN` must be a bare domain that is *verified in Resend* (Resend dashboard > Domains). Without it the app falls back to `onboarding@resend.dev`, which Resend only delivers to the email address of your own Resend account. Send failures are logged as `[auth] Resend rejected ...` in the Vercel runtime logs.
- **Database:** the Neon database must contain the `neon_auth.user`, `neon_auth.session`, `neon_auth.account`, and `neon_auth.verification` tables used by the Drizzle adapter.

## Blog dashboard

`/blog/dashboard` is a create/edit/delete UI for blog posts, restricted to the emails listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated, e.g. `ADMIN_EMAILS=you@eslotmain.xyz`). Anyone else who visits it is redirected to `/blog`; signed-out visitors are sent to `/signin` first. Sign in (or sign up) with one of those addresses to get a "Manage posts" link on `/blog` and `/account`.

Posts live in a `blog_posts` table that isn't created by anything else in this repo (there's no migration tool wired up) — run **`blog-posts-setup.sql`** once against your Neon database before using the dashboard. It also has an optional block to restore the one article that used to be hardcoded in `lib/blog.ts`.

Write the post body as plain text: a blank line starts a new paragraph, and a line starting with `## ` starts a new section with that heading. Read time and the URL slug (from the title, if you leave the slug field blank) are generated automatically.
